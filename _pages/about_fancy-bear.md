Fancy Bear Goes Phishing is a great read covering fascinating history. 

With captivating clarity, Shapiro explains the technicalities of infamous hacks like Paris Hilton's phone to the cyber attacks on the DNC (never have I seen buffer overflows explained so well!). 

But he goes further and critiques the social and psychological structures that make these scenarios possible. If you think cybersecurity is a purely technical problem, this book will change your mind. Highly recommend it - even for anyone with just a passing interest in cyber security.
