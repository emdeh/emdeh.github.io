Hi there, with over a decade of Australian-based public service experience in ICT Project and Service Delivery, I am now looking to pivot my career towards cybersecurity.

This is a space for me to build out a portfoliio and showcase some of my work.

I'll post CTF write-ups I complete, short conceptual explainers, and intend to do a series of POCs that demonstrate the importance of the Australian Signals Directorate's Essential Eight <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/essential-eight/essential-eight-explained"> Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents </a>.
