Hi there, this is a space for me to build out a portfoliio and showcase some of my work as I begin my journey in specialising in cyber security.

With over a decade of Australian-based public service experience in ICT Project and Service Delivery, I am now looking to pivot my career towards cybersecurity. I pride myself on my sharp attention to detail, ability to devise logical solutions to complex problems, and always considering the human element. I aim to continuously improve my skills, and love that there is always something new to uncover in cyber.
