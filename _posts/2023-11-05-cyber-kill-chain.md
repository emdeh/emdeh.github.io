# What is the Cyber Kill Chain Model?
The 'kill chain' concept is a borrowed military term that outlines the stages of an adversary's attack methodology. Intercepting attackers at multiple points increases the likelihood of disrupting the threat or forcing the adversary to take more detectable actions.

The prevailing application of kill chain models focuses on technology and overlooks the human element. Incorporating human aspects, like security awareness and end-user education, isn't just another security control; it's a unique approach to managing the fallibility humans introduce into any system or process.

# Applying the human element to Cyber Kill Chains
Distilling a kill chain into its constituent steps is often highly context-dependent. In general, however, it can be conceptualised into the following categories:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponisation
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Persistence
6. Command & Control
7. Actions on Objectives

The following will briefly consider the human element at each step and how it can disrupt or detect an attack.

## Reconnaissance
*Threat actors conduct preliminary information gathering.*

 An informed workforce or user-base, understanding their role as potential targets, can significantly reduce information leakage by exercising caution on social media, verifying identities over the phone, and securely disposing of sensitive documents. While not a strategy that can mitigate the risk completely, these practices can impede an attacker's reconnaissance efforts.

## Weaponisation
*Threat actors prepare appropriate tactics, techniques, and tools without direct contact with the target.*

 Limited security measures can disrupt this phase, except where a threat actor conducts preliminary testing on the target, in which case, an informed user-base can act as additional "sensors" of IoCs.

## Delivery 
*The threat actor launches the attack against the target.*

While technical solutions strive to block this phase, human intuition and adaptability can also play a crucial role. People are often the first line of defence in recognising and countering attacks, especially those involving social engineering.

## Exploitation
*The threat actor executes the attack by, for example, exploiting vulnerabilities.*

Educated users are more likely to maintain updated systems and use security software, reducing the chances of successful exploitation.

## Persistence
*Threat actors, particularly APTs, will attempt to establish persistence to a compromised target*

If an attack has reached this stage, technical solutions are arguably the best line of defence, but humans can, again, play a crucial role. With their daily interaction with systems, users are ideally positioned to notice anomalies in performance or behaviour that could be symptomatic of an attack.

## Command & Control
*Compromised systems contact external servers for further instructions.*

Proactive threat hunting aims to identify such suspicious communications.

## Actions on Objectives
*Threat Actors will pursue their ultimate goal within the compromised network.*

Again, security-conscious behaviours by users - such as using strong passwords and scrutinising login activities - can complicate attackers' efforts, enhancing the organisation's detection capabilities and delaying lateral movement, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.
