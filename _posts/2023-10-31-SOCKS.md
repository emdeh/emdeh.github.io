SOCKS stands for "SOCKet Secure" and is a protocol used for proxy servers. The protocol establishes a TCP connection to another server behind a firewall. The term "socket"  refers to the combination of an IP address and port number.

Here are the primary differences between SOCKS4 and SOCKS5:

## SOCKS4

- **Protocol Support**: Supports TCP only.
- **Authentication**: Doesn't support authentication natively. Anyone with the proxy address and port can use it.
- **Hostname Resolution**: Cannot resolve hostnames; requires the client to resolve the hostname to an IP address.

## SOCKS5

- **Protocol Support**: Supports TCP and UDP.
- **Authentication**: Provides a range of authentication mechanisms, including no authentication, username/password, and GSS-API.
- **Hostname Resolution**: Can resolve hostnames, which means you can pass a domain name that SOCKS5 will resolve for you.

Here's a simple comparison in terms of features:

|Feature|SOCKS4|SOCKS5|
|---|---|---|
|TCP Support|✅|✅|
|UDP Support|❌|✅|
|Authentication|❌|✅|
|Hostname Resolution|❌|✅|


SOCKS5 is generally considered more secure and versatile due to its advanced features like authentication and support for both TCP and UDP protocols.
