 Minister for Home Affairs and Cyber Security, Claire O'Neil, <a href="https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/ClareONeil/Pages/cyber-strategy-signals-generational-shift-response-growing-threat.aspx">announced today</a> Australia's Cyber Security Strategy through to 2030.

The <A href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/cyber-security-subsite/files/2023-cyber-security-strategy.pdf"> Strategy</a> presents a roadmap towards establishing Australia as a global leader in cyber security by 2030. Its core aim is to safeguard Australians by enhancing cyber security measures, managing cyber risks, and empowering citizens and businesses to navigate the cyber landscape more effectively. This vision is underpinned by the introduction of six cyber shields, each adding a layer of defense against cyber threats and prioritising the safety and prosperity of Australian citizens and businesses. These shields encompass:

1. Strong businesses and citizens
2. Safe technology
3. World-class threat sharing and blocking
4. Protected critical infrastructure
5. Sovereign capabilities
6. Resilient region and global leadership.

The Strategy marks a significant shift in Australia's approach to cyber security. It transitions from being a predominantly technical issue to a comprehensive national effort, focusing on enhanced support for civilians and the industry. Key aspects include:

- Tangible solutions addressing cyber security issues vital to Australian communities and businesses.
- A national collaborative approach to address cyber challenges, bolstered by stronger public-private partnerships.

Complementing the Strategy, the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Action Plan outlines critical initiatives for the next two years, setting Australia on the path to realising the strategy's vision.

Implementation of the Strategy's measures is detailed in the Action Plan, emphasizing government-wide initiatives. The first phase, Horizon 1, concentrates on reinforcing Australiaâ€™s cyber security foundations by bridging gaps in cyber defenses and fostering strong partnerships across industry and government to enhance national cyber resilience.
