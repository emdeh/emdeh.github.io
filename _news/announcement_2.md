 <a href="https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/news/policy-amendments-multiple-policies">Recent amendments</a> to the Protective Security Policy Framework were approved by the Australian Government's Security Committee.


A quick overview of some of the key changes:

**PSPF Policy 2:** Now mandates the appointment of a Chief Security Officer (CSO) with a minimum Negative Vetting Level 1 security clearance and a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) for cyber security leadership.

**PSPF Policy 5:** Updated to enhance reporting on significant security incidents and provides new guidance to support decision-making.

**PSPF Policy 8:** Renamed and changed the "OFFICIAL: Sensitive" Dissemination Limiting Marker to a security classification. No major changes to EPMS or access requirements.

**PSPF Policy 11:** Amended to reflect changes in Policy 8, renaming ‘OFFICIAL systems’ to ‘OFFICIAL: Sensitive systems’. Will be updated in Australian Signals Directorate’s ISM.

**PSPF Policy 16:** Removes outdated Type 1 security alarm systems and aligns with Policy 8 regarding the prohibition of SECRET information in Zone 2 spaces.
