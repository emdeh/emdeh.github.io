The <A href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/news-and-media/november-2023-essential-eight-maturity-model-update"> Australian Signals Directorate released an update to the Essential Eight Maturity Model today.

The model undergoes annual updates to ensure it remains relevant and practical for aiding organisations developing an up-to-date and resilient security posture. 

The updates draw upon various sources, including cyber threat intelligence, feedback from government and industry sectors globally, insights from penetration tests, Essential Eight assessments, uplift activities, and responses to ASD's annual cyber survey.

Key areas of focus in the latest update include:

1. Balancing patching timeframes to ensure timely response to vulnerabilities.
2. Increasing the adoption of phishing-resistant multifactor authentication to enhance security.
3. Improving the management of cloud services, considering their growing importance and unique security challenges.
4. Enhancing incident detection and response capabilities, particularly for internet-facing infrastructure, to quickly identify and mitigate potential breaches.
